         "You are the veritable sushi master! Prepare your own fun sushi with “Daizu” the skunk!\n\nThis app is designed to allow children to be creative by decorating their original sushi.\n\nServe your delicious, mysterious or impossible sushi to the people of “Tofu Island”! \n\nHow about creating sushi that is totally original and serve it to your beloved guests? Spice it up with tons of wasabi or even sprinkle chocolate and gummy bears for those sweet lovers.\nFeel free to make any kind of sushi you like at OH!Sushi and have your adventurous guests try them!\n\nFeatures\n- Guests will put in sushi orders but you don’t have to follow them. They love you and will enjoy whatever you make.\n- Can make hundreds of different Nigiri, Rolls and Gunkan sushi in 3 specialized kitchens. \n- In the Nigiri kitchen, freshness is key. So you start from catching the fish in the aquarium, then cut it up and put it on top of the rice. Be bold and pile up fish and wasabi if you want to. \n- In the Roll kitchen, fire the topping bazooka and spray the sushi fillings on the bed of rice. You can go super fat of super skinny, any way you want it. \n- In the Gunkan kitchen, top as much fish, meat, candy and popcorn as you wish. You can even take photos and use them as sushi toppings, too.\n- Now, let’s have the guests eat your creation. Look forward to their reactions!\n- There are no rules in this sushi bar. Be bold, silly and unique!\n\nAfter all, what child doesn’t like playing with food? We hope decorating their own sushi in a fun atmosphere will help them grow their imagination. Itadakimasu!",

The top card is face up, the rest face down. \nThe opening table has: \n7 tableau stacks, \n4 foundation piles, \nstock and waste pile. \nThe object of the game is to use all the cards in the deck to build the foundations up in suits from Ace, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack, Queen, King.\n\nHere is a brief description of what solitaire means.\nSolitaire card games free or games of patience, as they used to be known, is the category of card games played with one or more card decks and which objective is to move all the cards from one determined display to one pile or piles. Playing solitaire has with out doubt its uses. For example playing a solitaire game will keep you company during sleepless nights. For an stressed or worried mind it can be of great ease to relax by playing one or two games of solitaire.\n\nSolitaire games, also known as Patience in Britain, are Solitaire card games free for a single player. Does not exist a precise history of solitaires, but it is probable that solitaires are been born with the card games. The word solitaire is of french origin, and it means patience. The first book on the argument comes printed in 1870. It was Illustrated Card Games of Patience by lady Adelaide Cadogan, containing 25 card games, reprinted many times.\nNowadays, the most famous solitaire of them all is \"Klondike\", which takes its name due to the disposition of the cards on the tableau, which reminds the form of the \"Klondike\" mountain.",

This is probably the most popular solitaire games in the world.\n\nKlondike solitaire classic uses one deck (52 cards). Twenty-eight cards are dealt from the deck into the 7 tableau piles with the number of cards per pile increasing from one to seven from left to right. The top card is face up, the rest face down. \nThe opening table has: \n7 tableau stacks, \n4 foundation piles, \nstock and waste pile. \nThe object of the game is to use all the cards in the deck to build the foundations up in suits from Ace, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack, Queen, King.\n\nHere is a brief description of what solitaire means.\nSolitaire card games free or games of patience, as they used to be known, is the category of card games played with one or more card decks and which objective is to move all the cards from one determined display to one pile or piles. Playing solitaire has with out doubt its uses. For example playing a solitaire game will keep you company during sleepless nights. For an stressed or worried mind it can be of great ease to relax by playing one or two games of solitaire.\n\nSolitaire games, also known as Patience in Britain, are Solitaire card games free for a single player. Does not exist a precise history of solitaires, but it is probable that solitaires are been born with the card games. The word solitaire is of french origin, and it means patience. The first book on the argument comes printed in 1870. It was Illustrated Card Games of Patience by lady Adelaide Cadogan, containing 25 card games, reprinted many times.\nNowadays, the most famous solitaire of them all is \"Klondike\", which takes its name due to the disposition of the cards on the tableau, which reminds the form of the \"Klondike\" mountain.",

         "Frostborn",
         "Plunge into a true RPG game full of dynamic and spectacular adventures. Become a great viking and write your name in the history of ancient Scandinavia in the world of Frostborn!\n\nFrostborn is a new cooperative RPG where everyone will find a lot of ways to entertain themselves, for example, invite three more friends to play in cooperative mode or unite with other players into a clan to jointly build a base, attack enemies and so much more!\n\nAt the base, you will be able to store resources and properties, and also play defense from attacks of foe clans and enemies. For that you will need strong thick walls, various traps and a little bit of tricks. Don’t let strangers invade into your territory!.. Or break into bases of others and carry out a massacre! \n\nEspecially since there is a wide range of weapons and artifacts in Frostborn, each of which serves for a set mission with varying levels of hard hit. Even if you tend to change weapons like socks throughout the game, it will take a while to decide which ax or club is more fun to pile up corpses! \n\nGame features:\n* Realistic graphics\n* Co-op mode up to 4 players\n* PvP and PvE modes\n* Create or join a clan\n* Build a collective base\n* Vast in-game world\n* Plenty of locations and dungeons\n* Wide range of weapons\n* Rich craft system\n* Craft in-game transport\n* Spectacular world in the setting of ancient Scandinavia\n* Atmospheric sound design\n\nFrostborn stands out not with just outstanding graphics, but also extremely picturesque world - Ingard, an emerald land, strewn with lakes and dwelled by various animals. Yet breathtaking landscapes of Ingard are far from welcoming -- these lands are now flooded with hordes of the living dead!\n\nOnce these creatures got to the world of the living through the gate opened by Hel, the goddess of death. She took revenge on Odin, the ruler of Frostborn, for sending her to the underworld -- Helheim. Unable to leave the world of the living and pass over into Helheim, the undead get to Ingard through the rifts between the world of gods and the world of humans. \n\nThe few survived vikings summoned up all their strength and courage to exile evil from Ingard and return Thor and Odin’s grace - this is where your epic quest in Frostborn begins! The battle will be hard, worthy of true norse warriors! \n\nNote that in Frostborn you can choose the game pace that fits you best: leisurely fit out your base crafting items, placing plants, fireplaces and sofas, or jump on a carriage (in-game transport) and go to the external world to plunge into hunting of wild animals, killing the undead and fighting with other players. \n\nOpen all in-game locations that include: dangerous underground sanctums of Thor and Odin, Cursed Forests, Sacred Trees and Winter’s Gate -- the only pass to the northern lands where frost giants are believed to live. But be careful - apart from obvious dangers hidden in the lands of Ingard, you can also face other daredevil players...\n\nFrostborn is a beautiful, serious, relatively complex and modern game with great mechanics and an interesting storyline. Unravel all the mysteries, defeat Hel and save Ingard! BECOME A WARRIOR WORTHY OF ODIN’S HALL!",

         "Egyptian Basra",
         "Egyptian Basra is a very popular cards game in egypt, some times called \"Al Komi\" or \"Ash El Walad\". The Game is very simple:\n1- One of the two players will deal four cards for each, and in the beginning of the game he will include the ground with four ground two.\n2- Each player will throw one card to the ground until he is out of cards, then the dealer will deal again four cards each but not for the ground.\n3- Player goal is to take from the ground as many cards as he can. After the Dealer is out of cards. Each pile the players took through the game will be counted and the player who got the most cards will get the points. The other will be zero.\n4- What the player can take from the floor is either there is on the ground a similar card to what he has, or group of cards representing the sum in numbers to a card of his hand, the J, Q, and K are not included in the sum:\n- e.g. there are four cards on the floor A (have a value of 1), 7, K, and 8; if you have card 8 in your hand you will take 3 cards, the 8 and the 1+7 which equal the 8. or if has 9 he can take 8+1. If you have card K in your hand you will only take the K from the ground.\n5- If there is (card J or Diamond 7) in your hand you will take all the cards from the ground.\n6- when the ground is empty and next player throw one card of his hand (of course he will be careful not to throw J or diamond 7, these are special as demonstrated), If the other player have similar card in his hand he will take the card from the ground as additional bonus as called by Egyptians \"Basra\".\n7- the other situation to take \"Basra\" is when all the cards on the ground sum to one card in his hand in addition to any similar card have the same sum value:-e.g. the ground cards are (10, 5, 4, 1) and the player has 10, or (8, 7, 1) and the player has 8 ... etc.\n8- Also in the previous situation happens and the player has diamond 7 he will take the cards on the ground as \"Basra\". Diamond 7 is special card that has 2 roles called by Egyptians \"Al Komi\"; the other name of the same game; it will take basra of any value or as the J take all the ground.\n9- Be careful not to hold the J or Diamond 7 as last card in your hand as the other player may take the whole ground and burn your J or Diamond 7, as he will take either of them as \"Basra\" next time he play.\n10- If the dealer is out of cards, its time to count the cards which only the player with most of the cards will take this point. Also the number of Basra taken by the two players will be counted and both will take the Basra bonus.\n11- Several rounds will continue in which the two players will exchange the dealing role and the other player will start first until the target score is reached, and the winner announced.",

         "Plunge into a true RPG game full of dynamic and spectacular adventures. Become a great viking and write your name in the history of ancient Scandinavia in the world of Frostborn!\n\nFrostborn is a new cooperative RPG where everyone will find a lot of ways to entertain themselves, for example, invite three more friends to play in cooperative mode or unite with other players into a clan to jointly build a base, attack enemies and so much more!\n\nAt the base, you will be able to store resources and properties, and also play defense from attacks of foe clans and enemies. For that you will need strong thick walls, various traps and a little bit of tricks. Don’t let strangers invade into your territory!.. Or break into bases of others and carry out a massacre! \n\nEspecially since there is a wide range of weapons and artifacts in Frostborn, each of which serves for a set mission with varying levels of hard hit. Even if you tend to change weapons like socks throughout the game, it will take a while to decide which ax or club is more fun to pile up corpses! \n\nGame features:\n* Realistic graphics\n* Co-op mode up to 4 players\n* PvP and PvE modes\n* Create or join a clan\n* Build a collective base\n* Vast in-game world\n* Plenty of locations and dungeons\n* Wide range of weapons\n* Rich craft system\n* Craft in-game transport\n* Spectacular world in the setting of ancient Scandinavia\n* Atmospheric sound design\n\nFrostborn stands out not with just outstanding graphics, but also extremely picturesque world - Ingard, an emerald land, strewn with lakes and dwelled by various animals. Yet breathtaking landscapes of Ingard are far from welcoming -- these lands are now flooded with hordes of the living dead!\n\nOnce these creatures got to the world of the living through the gate opened by Hel, the goddess of death. She took revenge on Odin, the ruler of Frostborn, for sending her to the underworld -- Helheim. Unable to leave the world of the living and pass over into Helheim, the undead get to Ingard through the rifts between the world of gods and the world of humans. \n\nThe few survived vikings summoned up all their strength and courage to exile evil from Ingard and return Thor and Odin’s grace - this is where your epic quest in Frostborn begins! The battle will be hard, worthy of true norse warriors! \n\nNote that in Frostborn you can choose the game pace that fits you best: leisurely fit out your base crafting items, placing plants, fireplaces and sofas, or jump on a carriage (in-game transport) and go to the external world to plunge into hunting of wild animals, killing the undead and fighting with other players. \n\nOpen all in-game locations that include: dangerous underground sanctums of Thor and Odin, Cursed Forests, Sacred Trees and Winter’s Gate -- the only pass to the northern lands where frost giants are believed to live. But be careful - apart from obvious dangers hidden in the lands of Ingard, you can also face other daredevil players...\n\nFrostborn is a beautiful, serious, relatively complex and modern game with great mechanics and an interesting storyline. Unravel all the mysteries, defeat Hel and save Ingard! BECOME A WARRIOR WORTHY OF ODIN’S HALL!",

         "Egyptian Basra",
         "Egyptian Basra is a very popular cards game in egypt, some times called \"Al Komi\" or \"Ash El Walad\". The Game is very simple:\n1- One of the two players will deal four cards for each, and in the beginning of the game he will include the ground with four ground two.\n2- Each player will throw one card to the ground until he is out of cards, then the dealer will deal again four cards each but not for the ground.\n3- Player goal is to take from the ground as many cards as he can. After the Dealer is out of cards. Each pile the players took through the game will be counted and the player who got the most cards will get the points. The other will be zero.\n4- What the player can take from the floor is either there is on the ground a similar card to what he has, or group of cards representing the sum in numbers to a card of his hand, the J, Q, and K are not included in the sum:\n- e.g. there are four cards on the floor A (have a value of 1), 7, K, and 8; if you have card 8 in your hand you will take 3 cards, the 8 and the 1+7 which equal the 8. or if has 9 he can take 8+1. If you have card K in your hand you will only take the K from the ground.\n5- If there is (card J or Diamond 7) in your hand you will take all the cards from the ground.\n6- when the ground is empty and next player throw one card of his hand (of course he will be careful not to throw J or diamond 7, these are special as demonstrated), If the other player have similar card in his hand he will take the card from the ground as additional bonus as called by Egyptians \"Basra\".\n7- the other situation to take \"Basra\" is when all the cards on the ground sum to one card in his hand in addition to any similar card have the same sum value:-e.g. the ground cards are (10, 5, 4, 1) and the player has 10, or (8, 7, 1) and the player has 8 ... etc.\n8- Also in the previous situation happens and the player has diamond 7 he will take the cards on the ground as \"Basra\". Diamond 7 is special card that has 2 roles called by Egyptians \"Al Komi\"; the other name of the same game; it will take basra of any value or as the J take all the ground.\n9- Be careful not to hold the J or Diamond 7 as last card in your hand as the other player may take the whole ground and burn your J or Diamond 7, as he will take either of them as \"Basra\" next time he play.\n10- If the dealer is out of cards, its time to count the cards which only the player with most of the cards will take this point.

         "Frostborn",
         "Plunge into a true RPG game full of dynamic and spectacular adventures. Become a great viking and write your name in the history of ancient Scandinavia in the world of Frostborn!\n\nFrostborn is a new cooperative RPG where everyone will find a lot of ways to entertain themselves, for example, invite three more friends to play in cooperative mode or unite with other players into a clan to jointly build a base, attack enemies and so much more!\n\nAt the base, you will be able to store resources and properties, and also play defense from attacks of foe clans and enemies. For that you will need strong thick walls, various traps and a little bit of tricks. Don’t let strangers invade into your territory!.. Or break into bases of others and carry out a massacre! \n\nEspecially since there is a wide range of weapons and artifacts in Frostborn, each of which serves for a set mission with varying levels of hard hit. Even if you tend to change weapons like socks throughout the game, it will take a while to decide which ax or club is more fun to pile up corpses! \n\nGame features:\n* Realistic graphics\n* Co-op mode up to 4 players\n* PvP and PvE modes\n* Create or join a clan\n* Build a collective base\n* Vast in-game world\n* Plenty of locations and dungeons\n* Wide range of weapons\n* Rich craft system\n* Craft in-game transport\n* Spectacular world in the setting of ancient Scandinavia\n* Atmospheric sound design\n\nFrostborn stands out not with just outstanding graphics, but also extremely picturesque world - Ingard, an emerald land, strewn with lakes and dwelled by various animals. Yet breathtaking landscapes of Ingard are far from welcoming -- these lands are now flooded with hordes of the living dead!\n\nOnce these creatures got to the world of the living through the gate opened by Hel, the goddess of death. She took revenge on Odin, the ruler of Frostborn, for sending her to the underworld -- Helheim. Unable to leave the world of the living and pass over into Helheim, the undead get to Ingard through the rifts between the world of gods and the world of humans. \n\nThe few survived vikings summoned up all their strength and courage to exile evil from Ingard and return Thor and Odin’s grace - this is where your epic quest in Frostborn begins! The battle will be hard, worthy of true norse warriors! \n\nNote that in Frostborn you can choose the game pace that fits you best: leisurely fit out your base crafting items, placing plants, fireplaces and sofas, or jump on a carriage (in-game transport) and go to the external world to plunge into hunting of wild animals, killing the undead and fighting with other players. \n\nOpen all in-game locations that include: dangerous underground sanctums of Thor and Odin, Cursed Forests, Sacred Trees and Winter’s Gate -- the only pass to the northern lands where frost giants are believed to live. But be careful - apart from obvious dangers hidden in the lands of Ingard, you can also face other daredevil players...\n\nFrostborn is a beautiful, serious, relatively complex and modern game with great mechanics and an interesting storyline. Unravel all the mysteries, defeat Hel and save Ingard! BECOME A WARRIOR WORTHY OF ODIN’S HALL!",

Twenty-eight cards are dealt from the deck into the 7 tableau piles with the number of cards per pile increasing from one to seven from left to right.

The first book on the argument comes printed in 1870. It was Illustrated Card Games of Patience by lady Adelaide Cadogan, containing 25 card games, reprinted many times.\nNowadays, the most famous solitaire of them all is \"Klondike\", which takes its name due to the disposition of the cards on the tableau, which reminds the form of the \"Klondike\" mountain.",

         "Plunge into a true RPG game full of dynamic and spectacular adventures. Become a great viking and write your name in the history of ancient Scandinavia in the world of Frostborn!\n\nFrostborn is a new cooperative RPG where everyone will find a lot of ways to entertain themselves, for example, invite three more friends to play in cooperative mode or unite with other players into a clan to jointly build a base, attack enemies and so much more!\n\nAt the base, you will be able to store resources and properties, and also play defense from attacks of foe clans and enemies. For that you will need strong thick walls, various traps and a little bit of tricks. Don’t let strangers invade into your territory!.. Or break into bases of others and carry out a massacre! \n\nEspecially since there is a wide range of weapons and artifacts in Frostborn, each of which serves for a set mission with varying levels of hard hit. Even if you tend to change weapons like socks throughout the game, it will take a while to decide which ax or club is more fun to pile up corpses! \n\nGame features:\n* Realistic graphics\n* Co-op mode up to 4 players\n* PvP and PvE modes\n* Create or join a clan\n* Build a collective base\n* Vast in-game world\n* Plenty of locations and dungeons\n* Wide range of weapons\n* Rich craft system\n* Craft in-game transport\n* Spectacular world in the setting of ancient Scandinavia\n* Atmospheric sound design\n\nFrostborn stands out not with just outstanding graphics, but also extremely picturesque world - Ingard, an emerald land, strewn with lakes and dwelled by various animals. Yet breathtaking landscapes of Ingard are far from welcoming -- these lands are now flooded with hordes of the living dead!\n\nOnce these creatures got to the world of the living through the gate opened by Hel, the goddess of death. She took revenge on Odin, the ruler of Frostborn, for sending her to the underworld -- Helheim. Unable to leave the world of the living and pass over into Helheim, the undead get to Ingard through the rifts between the world of gods and the world of humans. \n\nThe few survived vikings summoned up all their strength and courage to exile evil from Ingard and return Thor and Odin’s grace - this is where your epic quest in Frostborn begins! The battle will be hard, worthy of true norse warriors! \n\nNote that in Frostborn you can choose the game pace that fits you best: leisurely fit out your base crafting items, placing plants, fireplaces and sofas, or jump on a carriage (in-game transport) and go to the external world to plunge into hunting of wild animals, killing the undead and fighting with other players. \n\nOpen all in-game locations that include: dangerous underground sanctums of Thor and Odin, Cursed Forests, Sacred Trees and Winter’s Gate -- the only pass to the northern lands where frost giants are believed to live. But be careful - apart from obvious dangers hidden in the lands of Ingard, you can also face other daredevil players...\n\nFrostborn is a beautiful, serious, relatively complex and modern game with great mechanics and an interesting storyline. Unravel all the mysteries, defeat Hel and save Ingard! BECOME A WARRIOR WORTHY OF ODIN’S HALL!",

         "Egyptian Basra",
         "Egyptian Basra is a very popular cards game in egypt, some times called \"Al Komi\" or \"Ash El Walad\". The Game is very simple:\n1- One of the two players will deal four cards for each, and in the beginning of the game he will include the ground with four ground two.\n2- Each player will throw one card to the ground until he is out of cards, then the dealer will deal again four cards each but not for the ground.\n3- Player goal is to take from the ground as many cards as he can. After the Dealer is out of cards. Each pile the players took through the game will be counted and the player who got the most cards will get the points. The other will be zero.\n4- What the player can take from the floor is either there is on the ground a similar card to what he has, or group of cards representing the sum in numbers to a card of his hand, the J, Q, and K are not included in the sum:\n- e.g. there are four cards on the floor A (have a value of 1), 7, K, and 8; if you have card 8 in your hand you will take 3 cards, the 8 and the 1+7 which equal the 8. or if has 9 he can take 8+1. If you have card K in your hand you will only take the K from the ground.\n5- If there is (card J or Diamond 7) in your hand you will take all the cards from the ground.\n6- when the ground is empty and next player throw one card of his hand (of course he will be careful not to throw J or diamond 7, these are special as demonstrated), If the other player have similar card in his hand he will take the card from the ground as additional bonus as called by Egyptians \"Basra\".\n7- the other situation to take \"Basra\" is when all the cards on the ground sum to one card in his hand in addition to any similar card have the same sum value:-e.g. the ground cards are (10, 5, 4, 1) and the player has 10, or (8, 7, 1) and the player has 8 ... etc.\n8- Also in the previous situation happens and the player has diamond 7 he will take the cards on the ground as \"Basra\". Diamond 7 is special card that has 2 roles called by Egyptians \"Al Komi\"; the other name of the same game; it will take basra of any value or as the J take all the ground.\n9- Be careful not to hold the J or Diamond 7 as last card in your hand as the other player may take the whole ground and burn your J or Diamond 7, as he will take either of them as \"Basra\" next time he play.\n10- If the dealer is out of cards, its time to count the cards which only the player with most of the cards will take this point. Also the number of Basra taken by the two players will be counted and both will take the Basra bonus.\n11- Several rounds will continue in which the two players will exchange the dealing role and the other player will start first until the target score is reached, and the winner announced.",

         "Plunge into a true RPG game full of dynamic and spectacular adventures. Become a great viking and write your name in the history of ancient Scandinavia in the world of Frostborn!\n\nFrostborn is a new cooperative RPG where everyone will find a lot of ways to entertain themselves, for example, invite three more friends to play in cooperative mode or unite with other players into a clan to jointly build a base, attack enemies and so much more!\n\nAt the base, you will be able to store resources and properties, and also play defense from attacks of foe clans and enemies. For that you will need strong thick walls, various traps and a little bit of tricks. Don’t let strangers invade into your territory!.. Or break into bases of others and carry out a massacre! \n\nEspecially since there is a wide range of weapons and artifacts in Frostborn, each of which serves for a set mission with varying levels of hard hit. Even if you tend to change weapons like socks throughout the game, it will take a while to decide which ax or club is more fun to pile up corpses! \n\nGame features:\n* Realistic graphics\n* Co-op mode up to 4 players\n* PvP and PvE modes\n* Create or join a clan\n* Build a collective base\n* Vast in-game world\n* Plenty of locations and dungeons\n* Wide range of weapons\n* Rich craft system\n* Craft in-game transport\n* Spectacular world in the setting of ancient Scandinavia\n* Atmospheric sound design\n\nFrostborn stands out not with just outstanding graphics, but also extremely picturesque world - Ingard, an emerald land, strewn with lakes and dwelled by various animals. Yet breathtaking landscapes of Ingard are far from welcoming -- these lands are now flooded with hordes of the living dead!\n\nOnce these creatures got to the world of the living through the gate opened by Hel, the goddess of death. She took revenge on Odin, the ruler of Frostborn, for sending her to the underworld -- Helheim. Unable to leave the world of the living and pass over into Helheim, the undead get to Ingard through the rifts between the world of gods and the world of humans. \n\nThe few survived vikings summoned up all their strength and courage to exile evil from Ingard and return Thor and Odin’s grace - this is where your epic quest in Frostborn begins! The battle will be hard, worthy of true norse warriors! \n\nNote that in Frostborn you can choose the game pace that fits you best: leisurely fit out your base crafting items, placing plants, fireplaces and sofas, or jump on a carriage (in-game transport) and go to the external world to plunge into hunting of wild animals, killing the undead and fighting with other players. \n\nOpen all in-game locations that include: dangerous underground sanctums of Thor and Odin, Cursed Forests, Sacred Trees and Winter’s Gate -- the only pass to the northern lands where frost giants are believed to live. But be careful - apart from obvious dangers hidden in the lands of Ingard, you can also face other daredevil players...\n\nFrostborn is a beautiful, serious, relatively complex and modern game with great mechanics and an interesting storyline. Unravel all the mysteries, defeat Hel and save Ingard! BECOME A WARRIOR WORTHY OF ODIN’S HALL!",

         "Egyptian Basra is a very popular cards game in egypt, some times called \"Al Komi\" or \"Ash El Walad\". The Game is very simple:\n1- One of the two players will deal four cards for each, and in the beginning of the game he will include the ground with four ground two.\n2- Each player will throw one card to the ground until he is out of cards, then the dealer will deal again four cards each but not for the ground.\n3- Player goal is to take from the ground as many cards as he can. After the Dealer is out of cards. Each pile the players took through the game will be counted and the player who got the most cards will get the points. The other will be zero.\n4- What the player can take from the floor is either there is on the ground a similar card to what he has, or group of cards representing the sum in numbers to a card of his hand, the J, Q, and K are not included in the sum:\n- e.g. there are four cards on the floor A (have a value of 1), 7, K, and 8; if you have card 8 in your hand you will take 3 cards, the 8 and the 1+7 which equal the 8. or if has 9 he can take 8+1. If you have card K in your hand you will only take the K from the ground.\n5- If there is (card J or Diamond 7) in your hand you will take all the cards from the ground.\n6- when the ground is empty and next player throw one card of his hand (of course he will be careful not to throw J or diamond 7, these are special as demonstrated), If the other player have similar card in his hand he will take the card from the ground as additional bonus as called by Egyptians \"Basra\".\n7- the other situation to take \"Basra\" is when all the cards on the ground sum to one card in his hand in addition to any similar card have the same sum value:-e.g. the ground cards are (10, 5, 4, 1) and the player has 10, or (8, 7, 1) and the player has 8 ... etc.\n8- Also in the previous situation happens and the player has diamond 7 he will take the cards on the ground as \"Basra\". Diamond 7 is special card that has 2 roles called by Egyptians \"Al Komi\"; the other name of the same game; it will take basra of any value or as the J take all the ground.\n9- Be careful not to hold the J or Diamond 7 as last card in your hand as the other player may take the whole ground and burn your J or Diamond 7, as he will take either of them as \"Basra\" next time he play.\n10- If the dealer is out of cards, its time to count the cards which only the player with most of the cards will take this point. Also the number of Basra taken by the two players will be counted and both will take the Basra bonus.\n11- Several rounds will continue in which the two players will exchange the dealing role and the other player will start first until the target score is reached, and the winner announced.",
